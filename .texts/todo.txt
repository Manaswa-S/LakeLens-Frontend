1)  navigating to the feedback form, somehow triggers the settings update func.

2)  input validation should be done, none will be done in the base dev tho

3)  have a mark in the sidebar for each item, denoting if it is valid, checked, authenticated, etc.
    so like on each refresh of the sidebar, also check if the locations are active and all.
